The Zéphyr sensor is an instrument that measures up to 9 physical air quality parameters:

* particles from 1 to 10µm: PM1, PM2.5, PM4 and PM10 
* Volatile Organic Compounds VOCs
* Nitrogen Oxides Nox
* Air humidity
* Ambient temperature
* CO2 content (optional)  

It was developed during the fight against the A69 motorway project (Tarn/Haute-Garonne, Occitanie region in France) to oppose the establishment of two bitumen power plants whose authorities government authorities did not fully appreciate public health and environmental issues.

The operation was carried out at the initiative of the Lauragais Sans Bitume [LSB](https://www.lauragais-sansbitume.fr/) collective, supported by 11 other local bitumen-free collectives.

The sensors and the computer architecture to manage the data were designed by a group of enlightened amateurs from the territory impacted by the power plants, supported by the Granas de Carderas association which distributes the sensors from its [HelloAsso](https://www.helloasso.com/associations/granas-de-carderas) sales website.

The sensors deployed (more than 60 to date) send their data every 5 minutes to a server which allows the owners of the sensors to access a dashboard and everyone to view the mapping of the quality of air in real time.
